ENTRY       map04917                    Pathway
NAME        Prolactin signaling pathway
DESCRIPTION Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone known to be involved in a wide range of biological functions including osmoregulation, lactation, reproduction, growth and development, endocrinology and metabolism, brain and behavior, and immunomodulation. PRL mediates its action through PRLR, a transmembrane protein of the hematopoietin cytokine receptor superfamily. At the protein level, the long PRLR isoform (long-R) and several short PRLR isoforms (short-R) have been detected. Acting through the long-R, PRL activates many signaling cascades including Jak2/Stat, the major cascade, Src kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. PRL cannot activate Jak2/Stat5 through the short-R, but can activate pathways including MAPK and PI3K pathways.
