NAME        Other types of O-glycan biosynthesis
DESCRIPTION O-mannosyl glycans are a type of O-glycans that are found both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Biosynthesis of O-mannosyl glycans is initiated by the transfer of mannose from Man-P-Dol to serine or threonine residue, which is catalyzed by protein O-mannosyltransferases POMT1 and POMT2. Defects of these genes are linked to human diseases, such as muscular dystrophies caused by reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscles [DS:H00120].
