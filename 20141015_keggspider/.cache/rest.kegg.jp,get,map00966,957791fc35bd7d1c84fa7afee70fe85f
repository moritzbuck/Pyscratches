NAME        Glucosinolate biosynthesis
DESCRIPTION Glucosinolates are biologically active secondary metabolites found in Brassicaceae (mustard family) and related families.These compounds are genetically variable within plant species and used as natural pesticides, such as against insect herbivores. All glucosinolates share a common structure consisting of a beta-thioglucose moiety, a sulfonated oxime moiety, and a variable aglycone side chain derived from an alpha-amino acid. Genes encoding glucosinolate biosynthetic enzymes have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by genetic polymorphisms and loss-of-function mutations. This map shows examples of side chain elongation in methionine-derived glucosinolates and the core pathway for biosynthesis of glucosinolates from amino acids.
