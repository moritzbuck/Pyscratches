ENTRY       map04011                    Pathway
NAME        MAPK signaling pathway - yeast
DESCRIPTION The S. cerevisiae genome encodes multiple MAP kinase orthologs. One (Fus3) mediates cellular response to peptide pheromones. Another (Kss1) permits adjustment to nutrient limiting conditions. A third (Hog1) is necessary for survival under hyperosmotic conditions. A fourth (Slt2/Mpk1) is required for repair of injuries to the cell wall. As in mammalian cells, these pathways consist of a conserved module in which three kinases phosphorylate each other in sequence. The MAPK is phosphorylated by the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which is itself phosphorylated by a MEK kinase (MEKK).
